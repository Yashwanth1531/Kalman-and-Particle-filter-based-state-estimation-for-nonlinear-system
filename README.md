# Kalman and Particle filter based state-estimation for nonlinear mechanical system
Application of two kinds of state estimators for a nonlinear mechanical system. The system is a two-dimensional crane (trolley) with a double pendulum (hook and a payload). The estimator only has access three sensors position of cart and the angle of two pendulums. Remaining states are estimated using linear Kalman filter and Particle filter.
